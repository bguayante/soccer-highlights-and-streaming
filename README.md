## Soccer Highlights and Streaming

This is a small app that makes use of React.js and CSS Grids to display match highlights fetched from a public API. The purpose of creating this is personal and practical; I love soccer, but often don't have time to watch matches live. Highlights are difficult to find from reputable sites. In most cases, the individual clubs, leagues, and broadcasters provide them spearately in some shape or form about 24 hours after a match ends, by which time the scores are already widely publicized. The alternative to this method that makes highlights available almost immediately is to visit the shady underbelly of unauthorized sports sites, which is not only illegal but also risky as these sites typically do not vet their advertisers and so raise security issues. 

Luckily, I found a public API that provides dozens of recent highlights with a single GET request. The site itself is ad-free and its videos link back to the site itself. This is fine for now. As time permits, I would like to extract the source URL for each video from the API and play it directly within this app without the need to redirect to the API provider's site. I have created the media player component, but it is not yet implimented.
